## ✨ Overview

Selenium_QA_Test is a comprehensive automation framework designed to facilitate reliable and maintainable UI testing for web applications. Built with Selenium WebDriver and following the Page Object Model, it automates complex user workflows, such as job application processes, with stability and clarity. The framework emphasizes explicit waits, minimal URL access, and clear assertions to ensure robust test execution. It also captures screenshots on failures for easier debugging. Centralized management of WebDriver instances and waits enhances reliability, while modular page objects promote maintainability. Ideal for teams seeking scalable, end-to-end testing solutions, Selenium_QA_Test streamlines quality assurance and regression testing across dynamic web environments.
